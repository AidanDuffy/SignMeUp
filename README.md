## Basic Overview
This is a basic program that I am writing to aid local swimmers and triathletes in the North New Jersey area lock down swim times for their training schedule. 
## Problem  
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, YMCAs in this area only allow one person per lane and open time slots one week in advance (ex: if it is 3:58 PM on a Tuesday, in two minutes, next Tuesday's time slot for 4:00 PM will become available). Due to restrictions, these spots fill up very quickly, and swimmers who do not want to waste any time are usually in the pool by the time spots open up at their favorite time. 
## Solution
This program will automate the signup process so these atheletes do not need to concern themselves with the administrative side of the process.
