# SignMeUp

## Basic Overview

This is a basic program that I am writing to aid local swimmers and triathletes
in the North New Jersey area lock down swim times for their training schedule.

## Problem

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, YMCAs in this area only allow one person per lane
and open time slots one week in advance (ex: if it is 3:58 PM on a Tuesday, in
two minutes, next Tuesday's time slot for 4:00 PM will become available). Due
to restrictions, these spots fill up very quickly, and swimmers who do not want
to waste any time are usually in the pool by the time spots open up at their
favorite time.

## Solution

This program will automate the signup process so these atheletes do not need to
concern themselves with the administrative side of the process.

## Installation Guide
[Download the SignMeUpSwim.zip](https://github.com/AidanDuffy/SignMeUp/blob/master/SignMeUpSwim.zip) file in the main directory. Prior to running, please ensure you have the most [up-to-date version of Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed on your machine. If your anti-virus software or firewall asks for permission to run or tries to flag the program, please approve it as I have yet to setup the relevant flags to ensure that AV software does not view this as a virus... From there, run the main.exe file **twice**: once to input your personal information, then you will need to run it a second time (and any other time) you wish to have the program book a time for you. Currently it only supports booking times the **same day**, so it is suggested that you set it up for your desired time prior to departing for the Y.
